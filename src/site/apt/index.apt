C5Connector.Java

  ... the Java backend for the {{{http://github.com/simogeo/Filemanager}filemanager of corefive}}. 
  It's a bridge between the filemanager and a storage backend and works like a transparent virtual file system or a proxy.
  C5Connector.Java includes a default implementation to access the (server side) local filesystem.
  
  The API encapsulates the building of JSON and is targeted to be used within JSPs as well as template engine like
  {{{http://velocity.apache.org}Velocity}} or {{{http://freemarker.org}FreeMarker}}.
  
  If the API should be used with the {{{http://ckeditor.com}CKEditor}}, I suggest to use it with {{{http://th-schwarz.github.com/CKEditor.Java/}CKEditor.Java}},
  a simple java backend of the CKEditor.
    
  [Hint:] It's an early-state project and should not to be used in a productive environment! 
          
          This project is managed as a side job. I'm aware of the lack of documentation and try to extend it constantly. \
          Please be patient!
